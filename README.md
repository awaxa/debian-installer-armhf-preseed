# debian installer armhf preseed

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/awaxa/debian-installer-armhf-preseed.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/awaxa/debian-installer-armhf-preseed)

Tags cause travis to publish a [release](https://github.com/awaxa/debian-installer-armhf-preseed/releases) of `partition.img.gz` (with `preseed.cfg` added to the `initrd.gz` therein).  These are designed for use with the SD card installation procedure described [here](https://wiki.debian.org/InstallingDebianOn/Allwinner#Installing_from_an_SD_card_image)
